# Concurrency Review Skill

> Review Java concurrent code for thread safety, race conditions, and modern patterns (JDK 21 LTS baseline with notes for JDK 24/25)

## What It Does

Reviews multi-threaded Java code for:
- Race conditions and visibility issues
- Deadlock potential
- Modern patterns (Virtual Threads, Structured Concurrency)
- Spring @Async pitfalls
- CompletableFuture error handling
- Thread pool configuration

## Why It Matters

Concurrency bugs are hard to reproduce, hard to test, and hard to debug. Catching them in code review is far better than finding them in production.

## When to Use

- "Review this for thread safety"
- "Check concurrency issues"
- "Is this async code correct?"
- Reviewing code with `synchronized`, `volatile`, `@Async`
- Checking `CompletableFuture` or `ExecutorService` usage

## Key Topics Covered

### Modern Java (JDK 21 baseline + notes for 24/25)
| Topic | What to Check |
|-------|---------------|
| Virtual Threads | Use for I/O-bound, not CPU-bound |
| Structured Concurrency | Proper scope management (preview; API differs by JDK) |
| ScopedValue | Prefer over ThreadLocal for bounded context |

### Spring @Async
| Pitfall | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| Same-class call | Bypasses proxy, runs sync |
| Non-public method | Proxy can't intercept |
| Default executor | Creates thread per task (OOM risk) |
| SecurityContext | ThreadLocal doesn't propagate |

### Classic Issues
| Issue | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Race condition | Check-then-act without sync |
| Visibility | Missing volatile |
| Deadlock | Inconsistent lock ordering |

## Example Usage

```
You: Review this service for thread safety

Claude: [Checks shared mutable state]
        [Validates synchronization]
        [Reviews @Async configuration]
        [Checks CompletableFuture error handling]
        [Suggests modern alternatives if applicable]
```

## Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🔴 High | Likely bug - race condition, deadlock risk |
| 🟡 Medium | Potential issue - measure/verify |
| 🟢 Modern | Opportunity for JDK 21+ modern concurrency patterns |
