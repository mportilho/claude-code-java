> Reusable AI development infrastructure for Java projects, optimized for Claude Code

## What is this?

A collection of reusable components for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) - Anthropic's agentic coding tool. The core of this project is a set of **skills** (structured markdown files that provide Claude with domain knowledge and workflows), but it also includes project templates, MCP server configurations, and setup scripts.

**Who is this for?** Java developers using Claude Code who want consistent, high-quality AI assistance for common tasks like code reviews, testing, commits, and architecture decisions.

## Purpose

AI-powered development workflows with focus on:
- **Token efficiency** - Designed for fewer iterations and lower token usage
- **Reproducible patterns** - Reusable workflows across projects
- **Java ecosystem** - Tailored for Java/Maven development
- **Incremental adoption** - Start small, expand as needed

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone this workspace
```bash
git clone https://github.com/decebals/claude-code-java.git ~/projects/claude-code-java
cd ~/projects/claude-code-java
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### 2. Setup your Java project
```bash
./scripts/setup-project.sh ~/projects/your-java-project
```

This creates `.claude/` with symlinked skills, generates `CLAUDE.md`, and configures settings.

**Prefer manual setup?** Just copy or symlink the skills you want:
```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.claude/skills

# Copy specific skills
cp -r ~/projects/claude-code-java/.claude/skills/java-code-review your-project/.claude/skills/

# Or symlink all skills
ln -s ~/projects/claude-code-java/.claude/skills/* your-project/.claude/skills/
```

### 3. Use with Claude Code
```bash
cd ~/projects/your-java-project
claude

# Skills load automatically based on context, or invoke directly:
> /git-commit
> /java-code-review
```

## Available Skills (20)

Skills are automatically loaded by Claude Code based on context.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Link skills** to your Java project
2. **Start Claude Code** in project directory
3. **Load skill** relevant to current task
4. **Execute workflow** with natural language
5. **Measure results** (tokens used, time saved)

## Success Metrics

Track these to validate effectiveness:

- **Token reduction**: Track your improvement vs manual workflows
- **Time savings**: Measure before/after per task
- **Reusability**: Number of projects using skills
- **Quality**: Code review feedback, test coverage

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed
- Java 11+ projects (Java 17+ recommended)
- Git for version control
- Maven or Gradle build tool
- (Optional) [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) for issue management

## What's Included

- 20 skills (workflow, code quality, architecture, frameworks)
- Setup automation scripts
- Project templates
- YAML frontmatter for automatic skill detection

## Used in automated code review

These skills are not just for code generation — they are also used as the **single source of truth** for automated code review via [`skill-review`](https://github.com/decebals/skill-review), a reusable GitHub Actions workflow that evaluates pull requests against the same skills that Claude Code uses during development.

Same skills. From generation to review. See [`skill-review-sandbox`](https://github.com/decebals/skill-review-sandbox) for a working example.

## Contributing

Skills are evolving based on real-world usage. Try them, open issues, share what works.

1. Try the skills in your projects
2. Open issues for suggestions
3. Share token savings/improvements
